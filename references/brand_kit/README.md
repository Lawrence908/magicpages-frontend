### ✅ `brand_config.yaml`
A structured YAML file containing:

Markdown files broken out by section:
- `brand_identity.md`

- `aesthetic.md`
- `social_media.md`

**Use these for:**

### 📄 Sliced PDF Pages
Each page of the original brand PDF is split into its own file:

**Use these for:**
- Reference in meetings or print design
- Embedding in documentation or presentations
- Version-controlled updates of brand visuals

## 💡 Tips for Usage

- Import `brand_config.yaml` in your backend/frontend to drive consistent color/font settings.
- Pair it with your CSS or Tailwind configuration.
- Integrate fonts and CTAs into email platforms like Mailchimp, Klaviyo, or custom Django templates.
- Use Markdown content as base for AI-generated content to ensure tone and visuals remain on brand.
